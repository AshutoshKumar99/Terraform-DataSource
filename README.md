# Terraform-DataSource
Data Sources-Data Sources are a way Terraform can query AWS and return a result.
Essentially what Data Sources do is you make an API request to get info.That's all they do.They don't actually set anything up. 
Use case- Might be getting latest AMIs,querying your infra.
YOu can use it for ami, backups, users etc.
